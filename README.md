# Web-Scraper-1.0
A web scraper optimised for pulling out tags and classes from a provided URL. As stated in the distribution code, gaining permission to web scrape is left up to the user!
This scraper uses beautiful soup and iteration to take multiple tag and class arguments from the user, alongside a URL the user provides, to then scrape the given URL and generate a CSV file containing the html that has been scraped.
Any bugs please contact, I plan to create another scraper or add to this one in the future to enable further scraping from attributes within certain tags e.g. src for images.
Enjoy!
